## System Requirements

Design a system in which car dealers can publish their cars for rent.

Each car ad must contain manufacturer, model, category, image, and price per day. Categories have a description and must be one of the following - economy, compact, estate, minivan, SUV, and cargo van. Additionally, each vehicle should list the following options: with or without climate control, number of seats, and transmission type.

The system should allow users to filter the cars by category, manufacturer, and price range anonymously. Ads can be sorted by manufacturer or by price.

When a user chooses a car, he needs to call the dealer on the provided phone and make the arrangement. The dealer then needs to edit the car ad as “currently unavailable” manually. The system must not show the unavailable cars.
