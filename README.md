# DDD Workshop

## System Requirements

Design a system in which car dealers can publish their cars for rent.

Each car ad must contain manufacturer, model, category, image, and price per day. Categories have a description and must be one of the following - economy, compact, estate, minivan, SUV, and cargo van. Additionally, each vehicle should list the following options: with or without climate control, number of seats, and transmission type.

The system should allow users to filter the cars by category, manufacturer, and price range anonymously. Ads can be sorted by manufacturer or by price.

When a user chooses a car, he needs to call the dealer on the provided phone and make the arrangement. The dealer then needs to edit the car ad as `currently unavailable` manually. The system must not show the unavailable cars.


## Defining the Initial Domain Model

- **Dealer Aggregate**
  - **Dealer** - **Entity**, **Aggregate Root**
  - **Phone Number** - **Value Object**, part of **Dealer Aggregate** 
- **Car Ad Aggregate**
  - **Car Ad** - **Entity**, **Aggregate Root**
  - **Car Manufacturer** - **Entity**, part of **Car Ad Aggregate**
  - **Car Category** - **Entity**, part of **Car Ad Aggregate**
  - **Car Options** - **Value Object**, part of **Car Ad Aggregate** 

### Define Some Base Classes

- **Entity** – contains common logic for entities – identifier and equality (example for [Identity Based Equality](https://github.com/pirocorp/Object-Oriented-Design/tree/main/12.%20Other%20Patterns/02.%20Identity%20Based%20Equality))
- **ValueObject** – contains common logic for value objects - equality (more info for [Value Object Pattern](https://github.com/pirocorp/Object-Oriented-Design/tree/main/13.%20DDD/Value%20Object))
- **Enumeration** – contains common enumeration methods (more info at [Use enumeration classes instead of enum types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/enumeration-classes-over-enum-types))
- **Guard** – contains common validation methods
- **BaseDomainException** – a base class for all domain exceptions
